This file gives an overview of the files used for replicating the
results of this project. For a general overview of the project please
refer to the [README.md](/README.md) file.

Included Files
--------------

-   [import.R](/import.R): instructions on importing the Stata data
    files (.dta) into R and saving each wave to a separate .RData file
-   [transform.R](/transform.R): contains the R instructions to perform
    the required transformations to the data

Excluded Files
--------------

These data source files are not included as they are licenced to be
distributed only via the DataFirst portal. However, they can be created
by using the R scripts described above and provided on the main page of
the repository.

-   [imported.RData](/imported.RData): contains all the imported
    separate data frames
-   [transformed.Child.W1.RData](/transformed.Child.W1.RData): Contains
    the Child data frame with inserted need variables for Wave 1

Data
----

The data used in this project has been collected and processed by the
[National Income Dynamics Survey of South
Africa](http://www.nids.uct.ac.za/). Which is conducted by the Southern
Africa Labour and Development Research Unit
([SALDRU](http://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/)), which is based at the
University of Cape Townâ€™s School of Economics.

The data can be downloaded from the [DataFirst
postal](http://www.saldru.uct.ac.za/). They can be downloaded here free
of cost, once an account has been created.

At the time of writing, there are three available data sets (waves).

-   [Wave
    1](http://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/central/about)
-   [Wave
    2](http://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/451)
-   [Wave
    3](http://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/452)

The data is offered in three (or four) formats.

-   SPSS
-   Stata 12
-   SAS
-   (sometimes) Stata 8

For the purpose of importing into R, the Stata 12 format is prefered.
Both the SPSS and the SAS format do not import very well and the Stata 8
format is obsolete. The Stata files are available here (when logged in).

-   [Wave
    1](http://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/453)
-   [Wave
    2](http://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/451/download/6038)
-   [Wave
    3](http://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/452/download/6001)

After having downloaded the above mentioned zip files, place them in the
project directory (i.e. the same folder as this file is in,
Gender-Child-Growth).

Replicate
---------

The procedure for replication is described step-by-step below, whereby
each section corresponds to an R-file. In stead of running every file
separately, all files can be ran in the correct sequence, by running the
[replicate.R](/replicate.R) file. As described above, the source **zip
files** need to be placed in the working directory.

Extract
-------

The [extract.R](/extract.R) file contains instructions for unzipping the
zip files containing the **Stata 12** files. The script presumes the
files are located in the working directory. All files will be unzipped
to a new subdirectory called **stata12**.

We can list the extracted files.

    list.files('stata12')

    ## character(0)

Import
------

The unzipped files are best imported with the R package called
**foreign**. Full instructions for importing the data into R can be
found in the [import.R](/import.R) file.

The imported data objects are saved to the file
[imported.RData](/imported.RData).

Transform
---------

The transformations applied to data are described in the file
[transform.R](/transform.R).

the transformed single panel data frame (pdata.frame, from the plm
package) is saved to the [transformed.RData](/transformed.RData) file.

Estimate
--------

Variables
---------

The transformed variables which are eventually used for the estimations
are described in [Variables.md](/Variables.md).
