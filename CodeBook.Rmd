--------------------------------------------------------

This Code Book gives an overview of the files used for replications. As well as a description of the transformations used. For a general overview of the project please refer to the [README.md](/README.md) file.

Files
--------------------------------------------------------
* [import.R](/import.R): instructions on importing the SPSS data files into R.


The data source files are not included as they are licenced to be distributed only via the DataFirst portal

Data
--------------------------------------------------------
The data used in this project has been collected and processed by the [National Income Dynamics Survey of South Africa][1].

The data can be downloaded from the [DataFirst postal][2]. They can be downloaded here free of cost, once an account has been created.

At the time of writing, there are three available data sets (waves).

* [Wave 1][3]
* [Wave 2][4]
* [Wave 3][5]

The data is offered in three (or four) formats.

* SPSS
* Stata 12
* SAS
* (sometimes) Stata 8

For the purpose of importing into R, the Stata 12 format is prefered. Both the SPSS and the SAS format do not import very well and the Stata 8 format is obsolete. The Stata files are available here (when logged in).

* [Wave 1][6]
* [Wave 2][7]
* [Wave 3][8]

The files are best imported with the R package called **foreign**. As described below in the section **Importing**.
