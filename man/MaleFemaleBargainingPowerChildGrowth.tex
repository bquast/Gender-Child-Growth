\section*{Abstract}

An exogenous male-only increase in cash transfer causes greater expenditure
on food, an improvement in Weight-for-Age Z-scores in young children,
and a deterioration in Height-for-Age Z-scores in very young children,
as observed in the context of South Africa's 2010 state pension expansion
for males. When estimated separately, these effects disappear for
girls, however for boys they remain intact, at a greater significance
level. In 2010 the male eligibility age for the South-African state
pension was brought on a par with female eligibility age (60, previously
65). I exploit this policy change in order to estimate the effects
of the male-only change in cash transfers, on growth of young children
living in the same household, as well as on food expenditure. The
policy change took place shortly after the completion of the first
wave of South Africa's National Income Dynamics Survey and shortly
before the start of the second wave, which lends itself well for a
Difference-in-Differences approach on the right hand side. On the
left hand side I use z-scores of the anthropometrics status of young
children in the household (against WHO standards) as well as food
expenditure.




\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:intro} Conditional Cash Transfer schemes are increasingly
common in developing countries, electronic systems have made it easier
to administrate these at a large schale, with lower incidences of
corruption. However, the efficacy of these schemes as compared in-kind
benefits such as universal health care if often brought into question,
especially where the recipient of the transfer is male. 

With this study I provide a close examination of the impact of cash
transfers to male household members. I examine a policy change in
the South African state pension that only benefits men, bringing down
the eligibility age from 65 to 60, on a par with women.

I find that this policy change leads to an increased expenditure on
food, improvements in weight-for-age and a deterioration in height-for-age
z-scores of young children in the household. Futhermore, when estimated
separately for boys and girls, the effect for girl disappears, for
boys the same effects remain intact.

The debate on CCTs and athropometric status is closely linked, malnutrition
can effect physical and cognitive development, which effect future
productivity and income , yet low levels of investment in Child health
are often observed, despite the ineffeciency of this. On a societal
level this affects i.a. growth, distribution, and welfare.

Most of the literature suggests that cash transfers to women are more
beneficial to children \citep{thomas1994like} . \citet{duflo2000child,duflo2003grandmothers}
studies South African state pension shortly after the policy change
that expended the system to include the black and other non-white
populations in 1993. That study finds that income that acrues to a
woman in the household leads to improvements in anthropometic status
z-scores of girls living in the same household. At the time of this
study in 1993, the male eligibility age was 65 and the female age
was 60, while average life expectancy in South Africa then and now
is significantly lower than that, complicating the comparison. 

This age discepancy was always considered discriminatory on the basis
of age. As a consequence of this, in 2010 the pension eligibility
age for South African men was lowered from 65 to 60 years old, at
a par with women's eligibile age. I exploit this policy change by
estimating a Difference-in-Differences model, quantifying the effect
of the male-only increase in cash transfers in households with men
aged 60 through 64.

Although Conditional Cash Transfer schemes (CCTs) are much more common,
it can be more informative to study Unconditional Cash Transfer schemes
(UCTs) as these suffer less from selection bias issues. State pension
systems are an opportune subject of study, since they are unconditional
upon reaching a certain age. 

The South African pension system is of particular interest, because
of the relatively high amount of the payout, upon the initial expansion
to include the black population, in 1991, this was a much as twice
the mean monthly income \citep*[see][]{tangwe2013impact}. As a result
of this, although the pension system was intended as a form of poverty
relief for the elderly population, it has also become that for the
South-African rural population, serving as a general source of income
to many households.

The lowering of the pension eligibility age for men took place in
between the first and the second wave of data collection for the South
African National Income Dynamics Study \citep{saldru2008nids,saldru2012nids,saldru2013nids},
which took place respectively in 2008 and 2012. This household survey
includes data on age, state-pension eligibility and receipts, children's
anthropometric z-scores, income, food/non-food expenditure, etc. The
children's z-scores are computed by comparing their anthropometics
against the WHO Child Growth Standards \citep{who2006child}.

The availability of data directly prior to and after the policy change,
enables me to estimate the effect of the cash transfer to the newly
eligible group of males aged 60 through 64 in their households using
a Difference-in-Differences approach. I estimate effect of this change
on food/non-food expenditure as well as on the anthropometric status
z-scores of young children living in the same households.

I find that the transfer leads to an increase in food expenditure,
but shows no significant impact on non-food expenditure. The effects
on the anthropometric of children in the same households are more
ambiguous. The change led to an improvement in the Weight-for-Age
z-scores, as well as a regression in the Height-for-Age z-scores of
younger children. When I estimate these equations separately for boys
and girls, the same variables have no significant effect for girls,
for boys the effects remain intact, at greater significance levels.

These results suggest that the increased expenditure in food results
in improvements in the short-term Weight-for-Age indicators, but at
the same time that the more long-term effect on Height-for-Age is
opposite to this. A possible explanation for this is that the increase
food expenditure goes towards unhealthy food, increasing weight, but
not leading to any long term increases in growth. Furthermore, the
separate estimations suggest that this change only affects boys.

The following \ref{sec:data} discusses the National Income Dynamics
Study, as well as the WHO Child Growth Standards used to compute the
anthropometric z-scores. This is followed by \ref{sec:methods} which
discusses the empirical model estimated, as well as the tools employed
for this. In \ref{sec:results}, I present the outcome of these estimations.
Finally, I interpret these results and their limitations in \ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{Data}

\label{sec:data}The main source of data is the South African National
Income Dynamics Study \citep[NIDS,][]{saldru2008nids,saldru2012nids,saldru2013nids}.
Several of the dataset's variables that for this study, in turn rely
on the World Health Organization's Child Growth Standards \citep{who2006child},
which are discussed at the end of this section.

The National Income Dynamics Study of South Africa is collected by
the South African Labour and Demographics Unit together with the World
Bank, it collects information on a representative set of approximately
ten thousand South-African households over time. Currently three `waves'
of data are available, these waves date from 2008, 2011, and 2013.
The primary types of information that I use are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item child anthropometrics status, Weight for Age \& Height for Age (\code{zwfa},
\code{zhfa});
\item food expenditure (\code{expf});
\item child age in days (\code{c\_age\_days1});
\item sex of the child (\code{woman}); 
\item pension eligible adult (\code{man\_60\_65}; \code{woman\_60\_65};
\code{man\_65}; \code{woman\_65}).
\end{itemize}
In addition to these variables of interest, I include a number relevant
of covariates, such as household income (\code{hhincome}), and in
the analysis.

In \tabref{haz_descr}, \tabref{waz_descr}, and \ref{tab:expf_descr}
descriptive statistics of each of the different Left-Hand Side (LHS)
variables are presented. Children's anthropometrics are taken, these
are length/height, weight, and waist. Using these anthropometrics
and WHO growth standards, z-scores are calculated.

In \ref{fig:man_60_65} descriptive statistics of the Right-Hand Side
(RHS) variable of interest are presented. Income from the state pension
system is generally the same at slightly more than 1000 ZAR, which
is about half of median income in the data set. I construct a dummy
variable for children living in a household with a man aged 60 until
65 (\code{man\_60\_65}). As well as dummies for a man 65 years or
older (\code{man\_65}) and these same dummies for children living
with women of those ages. The interaction of this dummy variable with
the event dummy \code{post\_treatment} is the variable of interest.

In addition to the explanandum, a number of relevant covariates are
included on the RHS. \tabref{income} gives a description of the distribution
of income as found in the NIDS dataset.

In 2006 the WHO published its standards for child growth\citep{who2006child},
superseding the previously used CDC Growth Charts of \citep[CDC Growth Charts: United States]{nchs2000cdc}.
The WHO charts map the average growth of an ethnically varied sample
of children living in households with healthy lifestyles, setting
a benchmark for growth.

These z-score anthropometrics are used since they are considered to
be a good representation of a child's health. 

For instance, if we measure a height $x$ for a child of age $y$
(in weeks/months), then we refer the to WHO tables, find the relevant
ideal height and standard deviation for a child of age $y$. We then
subtract the ideal height ($\mu_{y}$) from the observed height, and
divide by the standard deviation ($\sigma_{y}$), like so: 
\[
z_{xy}=\frac{x-\mu_{y}}{\sigma_{y}}
\]
These ideal scores are based on a sample of children from different
ethnic populations, in households which observed a healthy lifestyle.
Any health issues, such as malnutrition or disease will affect these
metrics, by causing the child to be shorter or lighter as compared
to these ideal standards. It is however not possible to distinguish
between the different causes of an observed slowed growth.

It is best practice to use only metrics for children between the ages
of 6 months and 60 months.

Here we use two type of z-scores, the Height-for-Age Z-score (HAZ)
and the Weight-for-Age Z-score (WAZ). Since these metrics are both
age-based, they provide information about all past growth issues.
Any past issues such a malnutrition and disease will have impaired
growth, and these effects will still be captured by today's height.
This also applies to the WAZ, as the ideal weight is a function of
the height, which is in turn a function of the age.

These are constructed on a weekly basis up to the age of 60 months,
and on a monthly basis thereafter.

The NIDS uses a file and data structure which is ill suited for panel
data analysis. I therefore transform the data to a format which is
more conducive to panel data analysis. For this I used `Tidy Data'
structure, as described in \citet{wickham2014tidy}.

\section{Empirical methodology}

\label{sec:methods} The identification strategy in this paper is
based on a policy change in the pension eligibility age for men. Until
mid 2009, men became eligible for pension at the age of 65. Between
mid 2009 and December 31st 2010, this was gradually lowered to 60.
I combine this information with data from the South-African National
Income Dynamics Study, a full-panel dataset, which contains information
on households from before and after this policy change. This policy
change falls between waves 1 and 2 of the NIDS, which took place in
2008 and 2012 respectively.

I study the effect of this policy change, on the anthropometric status
of children in the same household as pension recipients as well as
on food and non-food expenditure. 

This identification strategy is operationalised by constructing a
policy change or event dummy. This event dummy is called \code{event},
and takes the value \code{1} for data after the policy change (waves
2 \& 3), and the value \code{0} otherwise (wave 1). This dummy is
interacted with a dummy variable for having a man between 60 and 65
in the household (\code{man\_60\_65}), as well as with dummies for
men age 65 or older and dummies for women of the same ages.

In order to identify the effect of the policy change, I employ a Difference-in-Difference
estimation, using the fixed-effects estimator. I formulate two base
models. One model with the \code{event} dummy, and an interaction
term with male pension recipient (\code{man\_60\_65}). The second
model has the \code{event} dummy and an interaction term with the
eligibility dummy, as well as interaction term with the dummies for
women between 60 and 65 and women and men 65 and above.

Each of these models is estimated with both types of z-scores, as
well as food and non-food expenditure as dependent variables. 

The outcome variable is $y_{it}$, this outcome variable takes the
form of the of the z-scores, such as HAZ or WAZ or food/non-food expenditure.
Here $t$ denotes time and $i$ the individual. The individual and
time fixes effects are denoted by $\gamma_{i}$ and $\lambda_{t}$
respectively. Dummies for living in a household with a female or a
male pension recipient are included as $P_{it}^{f}$ and $P_{it}^{m}$
respectively. The dummy variable $T_{it}$ denoted the treatment status.
Lastly, $\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term, which is assumed to be
distributed as $\epsilon_{it}\sim N(0,\sigma)$.

\begin{equation}
y_{it}=\alpha_{i}+\lambda_{t}+\delta D{}_{it}+\beta X_{it}+\epsilon_{it}\label{eq:m1}
\end{equation}

In this, $\alpha_{i}$ represents the individual fixed effects, $\lambda_{t}$
represent the time fixed effects, and $X_{it}$ are the time varying
covariates. The error term is $\epsilon_{it}$. Finally the term of
interest is $D_{it}$ . 

As described above, I use a total of four dependent variables, Height-for-Age
(HAZ), Weight-for-Age (WAZ), and food and non-food expenditure. Each
of these is used in a different estimation as the Left-Hand Side (LHS)
variable. Combining these four LHSs with each of the three RHSs, gives
a total of twelve estimation equations. I present the results of the
estimation in \secref{results}.

\section{Results}

\label{sec:results} In  Table 6 and Table 7 I present the estimation
results for the equations with anthropometric status as the dependent
variables.

In \ref{tab:expf}, the results of the estimation using food expenditure
(\code{expf}) as a dependent variable are presented.

The variable \code{man\_60\_65} is a dummy variable for the child
living in the same household as a male aged 60 through 64.

The other rows represent the independent variables. Where \code{woman\_60\_65}
represents the dummy variable for children living in a household with
a state pension eligible woman aged 60 through 64. The variables \code{man\_65}
and \code{woman\_65} represent pension eligible men an women over
the age of 65 respectively. The event variable \code{event} is a
dummy which takes the value \code{TRUE} (i.e. \code{1}) for the
data collected after the policy change, i.e. waves 2 and 3 and \code{FALSE}
(i.e. \code{0}) for data collected before then. Lastly, I include
the covariate \code{hhincome} which represents total household income.

The key result in \ref{tab:expf} is the coefficient estimate for
the interaction term \code{eventTRUE:man\_60\_65TRUE}, which is positive
at \code{97.76} with a corresponding p-value of \code{0.04}. This
represents a 97.76 Rand (ZAR) increase on food expenditure in the
households which received the additional income through pension reciepts
of men aged between 60 and 65.

The coefficient estimates for the other independent variables take
form as is to be expected. The estimate for household income is positive
at \code{0.03} and highly significant at \code{0.00}. The parameter
estimates for the other household member dummies are all positive
and generally significant. The estimate for the child being a girl
(\code{womanTRUE}) is negative at \code{-12.61} but not significant.

When using Weight-for-Age (\code{zwfa}) as a dependent variable,
the coefficient of interest is positive at \code{0.36} and significant,
with a p-value of \code{0.026}. The interaction terms of the event
dummy with the other household member dummies, \code{man\_65}, \code{woman\_60\_65},
and \code{woman\_65}, are nowhere close to significant with p-values
of \code{0.74}, \code{0.18}, and \code{0.58}. These results can
similarly be seen in Figure 2, which shows the average lag in \code{zwfa}
for children living with a man between 60 and 65, before and after
the policy change on the left, as compared to children who do not
have such a household member on the right.

When using Height-for-Age (\code{zhfa}) as a dependent variable to
results is the opposite. I find a negative effect \code{-0.52} of
the treatment on the dependent variable, which is just significant
at a p-value of \code{0.09}. None of the interaction terms with any

As \ref{tab:waz1} and \ref{tab:haz1} show, the Weight-for-Age and
the Height-for-Age estimations for all three Right-Hand Side variations
give opposing results. For Height-for-Age z-scores as an explanandum,
we find that the policy variable interaction term \code{post\_treatmentTRUE:man\_60\_65TRUE}
has a negative coefficient estimate. While this interaction term has
a positive coefficient when using Weight-for-Age z-score as a dependent
variable.

Additionally, I estimate these equation separately for boys and girls.

\section{Conclusions and limitations}

\label{sec:conclusions}

The estimation results present three key results. Firstly, I find
that there is a significant and consistent positive effect of the
interaction term (\code{post\_treatmentTRUE:man\_60\_65TRUE} on food
expenditure. Secondly, there is a significant and consistent positive
effect of the interaction term (\code{post\_treatmentTRUE:man\_60\_65TRUE}
on the Weight-for-Age Z-score Thirdly, we find a consistent and negative
effect of the interaction term on the Height-for-Age Z-scores. Both
of these effect are consistent across the different specifications
used in our estimations.

The impetus for this paper is to gain a greater understanding of the
effects of Male/Female bargaining power in households, for instance
to improve designs of Conditional Cash Transfer schemes (CCTs). 

I do this by evaluating the z-scores of anthropometrics of children
between the ages of six and sixty months old, living in the same household
as recipients of the South-African old-age state pension system. I
then compare the z-scores for children living with male pension recipients,
which the z-scores of children living with female pension recipients.
This method employed here is similar to \citet{duflo2000child,duflo2003grandmothers}. 

I analyse data around a policy change, which lowers the pension eligibility
age for men from 65 to 60, which brings it at par with women's pension
eligibility age. There are two main reasons for further analysis of
outcomes surrounding this policy change.

Firstly, this overcomes major issues with attrition and the associated
selection bias of the discrepancy in pension eligibility age, especially
since average life expectancy is well below pension eligibility age.

Secondly, analysing data around the policy change allows me to employ
a Difference-in-Differences estimation (DiD). Which enables me to
draw a causal inference from the treatment effect.

I use the South-African National Income Dynamics Survey data \citep[jointly with The World Bank]{saldru2008nids,saldru2012nids,saldru2013nids}.
This full-panel dataset provides observations from 2008, 2012, and
2013. The treatment, a policy change which lowers the pension eligibility
age for men from 65 to 60, takes place in 2009 and 2010.  

In my estimations I use the Difference-in-Differences method, which
is operationalised as a random-effects panel model. I construct two
models on the Right-Hand Side. The first is a random-effects model
with an interaction between the event dummy and a dummy for having
a male aged 60 through 64 in the same household (\code{man\_60\_65}).
The second model is a random-effects estimation with the same interaction,
as well as an interaction terms with other dummies: \code{woman\_60\_65},
\code{man\_65}, and \code{woman\_65.}

On the Left-Hand Side (LHS) I use two different anthropometric z-scores,
Height-for-Age (HAZ) and Weight-for-Age as well as food en non-food
expenditure. 

Combining the three RHS models with the four LHS z-scores gives us
twelve estimation equations. When I estimate of these equations, I
find three effects key effects.

Firstly, the greater male bargaining power, ceteris paribus, leads
to an increase in food expenditure. Secondly, I observe a positive
effect of the Weight-for-Age z-scores. Thirdly, for very young children,
I find a deterioration in the Height-for-Age z-scores.

These effects seem to suggest that the greater male bargaining power
resulted in greater food expenditure, but possibly also a change in
the nature of the expenditure on food, helping improve the Weight-for-Age,
but not improving the Height-for-Age, with the later being a more
long term health indicator.

A key outcome of this research is that food expenditure is some way
too ambiguous a variable. The results of the increased food expenditure
are not altogether positive, leading to a deterioration in Height-for-Age.
In context such as these, the increased food expenditure would generally
be thought of as a positive development. By further analysing the
types of food purchased, it might be possible to better understand
the deterioration in Height-for-Age.

\section{Software}

The computation estimation of these models is performed using R \citep{R},
with the implementation of the panel data structure and models using
the \code{plm} package \citep{croissant2008panel}. All changes are
logged using the version control system Git \citep{git} and publicly
available on GitHub at \href{https://github.com/bquast/MaleFemale-Bargaining-Power-Child-Growth/}{https://github.com/bquast/MaleFemale-Bargaining-Power-Child-Growth/}\footnote{The repository can by cloned to a local computer by entering in following
command in a terminal (with Git installed):\\
\code{git clone https://github.com/bquast/MaleFemale-Bargaining-Power-Child-Growth.git}}.

In order to merge data and compute of these statistics, I make use
of the dplyr and tidyr R packages \citet{wickham2015dplyr,wickham2016tidyr}.
After having combined the various data.frames within each wave, the
three waves can be combined by simply joining the rows using base
R's \code{rbind()} function\citep{R}.
